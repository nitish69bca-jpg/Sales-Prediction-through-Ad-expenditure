# Sales Prediction Through Advertising Expenditure

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising expenditure across different marketing channels.  
The goal is to understand how spending on advertising influences sales and to build a machine learning model that can make accurate sales predictions.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between advertising spend and sales  
- Identify which advertising channels impact sales the most  
- Build a predictive model for sales forecasting  
- Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics

##  Machine Learning Model
- Linear Regression is used to predict sales based on advertising expenditure.
- Model performance is evaluated using metrics like:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
